### Step 1: Prepare Your Project

1. **Organize Your Files**: Ensure that your project files (including `index.html`, `sketch.js`, and all other JavaScript files) are in a single folder. This folder will be your project root.

2. **Check Your Paths**: Make sure that all file paths in your HTML file are correct. For example, if you have a folder structure like this:
   ```
   /game
     ├── index.html
     ├── sketch.js
     ├── js/
     │   ├── player.js
     │   ├── enemy.js
     │   └── ...
     └── css/
         └── styles.css
   ```
   Ensure that your `index.html` correctly references the JavaScript files in the `js` folder.

### Step 2: Create a GitHub Repository

1. **Sign in to GitHub**: Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in to your account.

2. **Create a New Repository**:
   - Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository".
   - Name your repository (e.g., `capital-quiz-game`).
   - Optionally, add a description.
   - Choose "Public" so that everyone can access it.
   - Click "Create repository".

### Step 3: Upload Your Files

1. **Upload Files**:
   - In your new repository, click on "Add file" and then "Upload files".
   - Drag and drop your project files (the entire folder structure) into the upload area or click "choose your files" to select them manually.
   - Once all files are uploaded, click "Commit changes" at the bottom.

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to Repository Settings**:
   - In your repository, click on the "Settings" tab.

2. **Scroll to GitHub Pages**:
   - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.

3. **Select the Source**:
   - Under "Source", select the branch you want to use (usually `main` or `master`).
   - Choose the root folder (or `/ (root)` if your files are directly in the root of the repository).
   - Click "Save".

4. **Wait for Deployment**:
   - After saving, GitHub will provide a URL where your site is hosted. It may take a few minutes for the site to be available.

### Step 5: Access Your Game

1. **Visit Your Game**:
   - Once GitHub Pages has deployed your site, you can access your game using the provided URL (e.g., `https://yourusername.github.io/capital-quiz-game/`).

2. **Share the Link**:
   - Share the link with others so they can play your game!

### Step 6: Update Your Game (Optional)

1. **Make Changes**:
   - If you need to make changes to your game, update the files in your local project folder.

2. **Push Changes to GitHub**:
   - Use Git commands to add, commit, and push your changes to the GitHub repository, or upload the updated files through the GitHub interface.

3. **Refresh the Page**:
   - After pushing changes, refresh the GitHub Pages link to see the updates.

### Additional Tips

- **Debugging**: If your game doesn’t work as expected, check the browser console for errors. Ensure all file paths are correct.
- **Responsive Design**: Make sure your game is responsive and works well on different screen sizes, especially since it will be accessed from various devices.
- **Documentation**: Consider adding a README file to your repository to explain how to play the game and any other relevant information.

By following these steps, you should be able to host your game on GitHub and make it accessible to everyone on the internet!
