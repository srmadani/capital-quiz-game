To host your game on GitHub so that everyone can play it through the internet, you can use GitHub Pages. Here’s a step-by-step guide to get your game online:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Project

1. **Organize Your Files**: Ensure that your project files are organized in a single folder. This should include:
   - `index.html`
   - All JavaScript files (e.g., `sketch.js`, `game-manager.js`, etc.)
   - Any other assets (images, stylesheets, etc.)

2. **Check Your Code**: Make sure your code is working locally. Open `index.html` in your browser to test it.

### Step 2: Create a GitHub Repository

1. **Sign In to GitHub**: Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in or create an account if you don’t have one.

2. **Create a New Repository**:
   - Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository".
   - Name your repository (e.g., `capital-quiz-game`).
   - Optionally, add a description.
   - Choose "Public" so everyone can access it.
   - Click "Create repository".

### Step 3: Upload Your Files

1. **Upload Files**:
   - In your new repository, click on "Add file" and select "Upload files".
   - Drag and drop your project files into the upload area or click "choose your files" to select them.
   - Once all files are uploaded, scroll down and click "Commit changes".

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to Repository Settings**:
   - Click on the "Settings" tab in your repository.

2. **Scroll to GitHub Pages**:
   - In the left sidebar, click on "Pages".

3. **Select the Source**:
   - Under "Source", select the branch you want to use (usually `main` or `master`).
   - Select the root folder (usually `/ (root)`).
   - Click "Save".

4. **Get Your URL**:
   - After saving, GitHub will provide a URL where your site is hosted. It will look something like `https://<your-username>.github.io/capital-quiz-game/`.

### Step 5: Test Your Game Online

1. **Open the URL**: Go to the URL provided by GitHub Pages to see your game live.
2. **Test Functionality**: Make sure everything works as expected in the online environment.

### Step 6: Share Your Game

1. **Share the Link**: You can now share the URL with anyone, and they can play your game directly in their web browser.

### Additional Tips

- **Update Your Game**: If you make changes to your game, simply upload the updated files to the same repository and commit the changes. The GitHub Pages site will automatically update.
- **Debugging**: If something doesn’t work, check the browser console for errors and ensure all file paths in your code are correct.
- **Documentation**: Consider adding a `README.md` file to your repository to explain how to play the game and any other relevant information.

By following these steps, you can successfully host your game on GitHub and make it accessible to everyone on the internet!
