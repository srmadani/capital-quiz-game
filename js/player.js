To host your game on GitHub so that everyone can play it through the internet, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Project

1. **Organize Your Files**: Ensure that your project files (including `index.html`, `sketch.js`, `README.md`, and all other JavaScript files) are organized in a single folder.

2. **Check Your Code**: Make sure your code is working locally. Open `index.html` in your browser to test the game.

### Step 2: Create a GitHub Repository

1. **Sign in to GitHub**: Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in to your account.

2. **Create a New Repository**:
   - Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository".
   - Name your repository (e.g., `capital-quiz-game`).
   - Optionally, add a description.
   - Choose "Public" so that everyone can access it.
   - Initialize the repository with a README if you want (you can also add it later).
   - Click "Create repository".

### Step 3: Upload Your Project Files

1. **Upload Files**:
   - Go to your newly created repository.
   - Click on the "Add file" button and select "Upload files".
   - Drag and drop your project folder contents (not the folder itself, just the files) into the upload area.
   - Click "Commit changes" at the bottom of the page.

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to Repository Settings**:
   - Click on the "Settings" tab in your repository.

2. **Scroll to GitHub Pages**:
   - In the left sidebar, click on "Pages".

3. **Select the Source**:
   - Under "Source", select the branch you want to use (usually `main` or `master`).
   - Choose the root folder (usually `/ (root)`).
   - Click "Save".

4. **Get Your URL**:
   - After saving, GitHub will provide a URL where your game is hosted. It will look something like `https://<your-username>.github.io/capital-quiz-game/`.

### Step 5: Test Your Game Online

1. **Open the URL**: Go to the URL provided by GitHub Pages.
2. **Play the Game**: Ensure that the game loads and functions correctly in the browser.

### Step 6: Share Your Game

1. **Share the Link**: You can now share the URL with anyone, and they can play your game directly in their web browser.

### Additional Tips

- **Debugging**: If you encounter issues, check the browser console for errors. Make sure all file paths in your code are correct.
- **Updates**: If you make changes to your game, repeat the upload process to update the files in your GitHub repository.
- **Custom Domain**: If you want a custom domain, you can set that up in the GitHub Pages settings as well.

By following these steps, you should be able to host your game on GitHub and make it accessible to everyone on the internet!
