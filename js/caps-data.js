To host your game on GitHub so that everyone can play it through the internet, you can use GitHub Pages. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to get your game online:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Project

1. **Organize Your Files**: Ensure that your project files (including `index.html`, `sketch.js`, and all other JavaScript files) are organized in a single folder. This folder will be your project root.

2. **Check Your Code**: Make sure your code is working locally. Open `index.html` in a web browser to test it.

### Step 2: Create a GitHub Repository

1. **Sign in to GitHub**: Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in to your account.

2. **Create a New Repository**:
   - Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository".
   - Name your repository (e.g., `capital-quiz-game`).
   - Optionally, add a description.
   - Choose "Public" so everyone can access it.
   - Click "Create repository".

### Step 3: Upload Your Project Files

1. **Upload Files**:
   - In your new repository, click on "Add file" and select "Upload files".
   - Drag and drop your project files (the entire folder contents) into the upload area or click "choose your files" to select them.
   - Once all files are uploaded, scroll down and click "Commit changes".

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to Repository Settings**:
   - Click on the "Settings" tab in your repository.

2. **Scroll to GitHub Pages**:
   - In the left sidebar, click on "Pages".

3. **Select the Source**:
   - Under "Source", select the branch you want to use (usually `main` or `master`).
   - Choose the root folder (`/`) as the folder to serve your site from.
   - Click "Save".

4. **Get Your URL**:
   - After saving, GitHub will provide a URL where your site is hosted. It will look something like `https://<your-username>.github.io/capital-quiz-game/`.

### Step 5: Test Your Game Online

1. **Open the URL**: Go to the URL provided by GitHub Pages to see your game live.

2. **Test Functionality**: Make sure all features work as expected in the online environment.

### Step 6: Share Your Game

1. **Share the Link**: You can now share the URL with anyone, and they can play your game directly in their web browser.

### Additional Tips

- **Debugging**: If you encounter issues, check the browser console for errors. Make sure all file paths in your code are correct.
- **Updates**: If you make changes to your game, repeat the upload process to update the files in your GitHub repository.
- **Custom Domain**: If you want a custom domain, you can set that up in the GitHub Pages settings as well.

By following these steps, you should be able to host your game on GitHub Pages and make it accessible to everyone on the internet!
