To host your game on GitHub so that everyone can play it through the internet, you can use GitHub Pages. Here’s a step-by-step guide to get your game online:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Project

1. **Organize Your Files**: Ensure that your project files (including `index.html`, `sketch.js`, and other JavaScript files) are organized in a single folder. This folder should contain all the necessary files for your game to run.

### Step 2: Create a GitHub Repository

1. **Sign in to GitHub**: Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in to your account. If you don’t have an account, create one.

2. **Create a New Repository**:
   - Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository".
   - Name your repository (e.g., `capital-quiz-game`).
   - Optionally, add a description.
   - Choose "Public" so that everyone can access it.
   - Click on "Create repository".

### Step 3: Upload Your Files

1. **Upload Files**:
   - In your new repository, click on "Add file" and then "Upload files".
   - Drag and drop your project folder contents (not the folder itself, just the files) into the upload area or click "choose your files" to select them.
   - Once all files are uploaded, scroll down and click "Commit changes".

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to Repository Settings**:
   - Click on the "Settings" tab in your repository.

2. **Scroll to GitHub Pages Section**:
   - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.

3. **Select the Source**:
   - Under "Source", select the branch you want to use (usually `main` or `master`).
   - Choose the root folder (if prompted).
   - Click "Save".

4. **Wait for the Page to be Published**:
   - After saving, GitHub will provide a URL where your game is hosted. It may take a few minutes for the page to be published.

### Step 5: Access Your Game

1. **Visit Your Game URL**:
   - The URL will typically be in the format: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`
   - For example, if your GitHub username is `reza` and your repository is named `capital-quiz-game`, the URL would be `https://reza.github.io/capital-quiz-game/`.

2. **Share the URL**:
   - You can now share this URL with anyone, and they can play your game directly in their web browser.

### Step 6: Update Your Game (Optional)

1. **Make Changes**:
   - If you need to update your game, make changes to your local files.

2. **Upload Changes**:
   - Repeat the upload process to update the files in your GitHub repository.

3. **Refresh the Game URL**:
   - After updating, refresh the game URL to see the changes.

### Additional Tips

- **Check Console for Errors**: If your game doesn’t work as expected, open the browser console (F12 or right-click > Inspect > Console) to check for any errors.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure your game is responsive and works well on different screen sizes, especially since it will be played on various devices.
- **Debugging**: Use the debug mode in your game to help identify any issues during testing.

By following these steps, you should be able to host your game on GitHub Pages and make it accessible to everyone on the internet!
