To host your game on GitHub so that everyone can play it through the internet, you can use GitHub Pages. Here’s a step-by-step guide to get your game online:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Project

1. **Organize Your Files**: Ensure that all your game files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) are in a single folder. The main HTML file should be named `index.html`.

2. **Check Your Code**: Make sure your code is working locally. Open `index.html` in your browser to test it.

### Step 2: Create a GitHub Repository

1. **Sign in to GitHub**: Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in to your account.

2. **Create a New Repository**:
   - Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository".
   - Name your repository (e.g., `capital-quiz-game`).
   - Optionally, add a description.
   - Choose "Public" so everyone can access it.
   - Do not initialize with a README or .gitignore (you can add those later if needed).
   - Click "Create repository".

### Step 3: Upload Your Files

1. **Upload Files**:
   - Go to your newly created repository.
   - Click on "Add file" > "Upload files".
   - Drag and drop your game folder contents (all files and subfolders) into the upload area.
   - Click "Commit changes" at the bottom of the page.

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to Repository Settings**:
   - Click on the "Settings" tab in your repository.

2. **Scroll to GitHub Pages**:
   - In the left sidebar, click on "Pages".

3. **Select the Source**:
   - Under "Source", select the branch you want to use (usually `main` or `master`).
   - Choose the root folder (usually `/ (root)`).
   - Click "Save".

4. **Get Your URL**:
   - After saving, GitHub will provide a URL where your game is hosted. It will look something like `https://<your-username>.github.io/capital-quiz-game/`.

### Step 5: Test Your Game Online

1. **Open the URL**: Go to the URL provided by GitHub Pages to see your game live.

2. **Test Functionality**: Make sure all features work as expected in the online version.

### Step 6: Share Your Game

1. **Share the Link**: You can now share the URL with anyone, and they can play your game directly in their web browser.

### Additional Tips

- **Update Your Game**: If you make changes to your game, repeat the upload process to update the files in your GitHub repository.
- **Debugging**: If something doesn’t work, check the browser console for errors and ensure all file paths in your code are correct.
- **Documentation**: Consider adding a `README.md` file to your repository to explain how to play the game and any other relevant information.

By following these steps, you should be able to host your game on GitHub and make it accessible to everyone on the internet!
