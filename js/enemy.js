To host your game on GitHub so that everyone can play it through the internet, you can use GitHub Pages. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to get your game online:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Project

1. **Organize Your Files**: Ensure that your project files (including `index.html`, `sketch.js`, and all other JavaScript files) are in a single folder. This folder should not contain any unnecessary files or folders.

2. **Check Your Code**: Make sure your code is working locally. Open `index.html` in your browser to test the game.

### Step 2: Create a GitHub Repository

1. **Sign in to GitHub**: Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in to your account.

2. **Create a New Repository**:
   - Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository".
   - Name your repository (e.g., `capital-quiz-game`).
   - Add a description (optional).
   - Choose "Public" so everyone can access it.
   - Do not initialize with a README or any other files.
   - Click "Create repository".

### Step 3: Upload Your Project Files

1. **Upload Files**:
   - In your new repository, click on "Upload files".
   - Drag and drop your project folder contents (not the folder itself) into the upload area or click "choose your files" to select them.
   - Once all files are uploaded, click "Commit changes".

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to Repository Settings**:
   - Click on the "Settings" tab in your repository.

2. **Scroll to GitHub Pages**:
   - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.

3. **Select the Source**:
   - Under "Source", select the branch you want to use (usually `main` or `master`).
   - Choose the root folder (usually `/ (root)`).
   - Click "Save".

4. **Wait for Deployment**:
   - After saving, GitHub will provide a URL where your site is hosted. It may take a few minutes for the site to be available.

### Step 5: Access Your Game

1. **Find Your Game URL**:
   - After a few minutes, go back to the "Settings" tab and scroll to the "GitHub Pages" section.
   - You should see a message indicating that your site is published at a URL like `https://<your-username>.github.io/capital-quiz-game/`.

2. **Test Your Game**:
   - Open the provided URL in your browser to test your game online.

### Step 6: Share Your Game

1. **Share the URL**: You can now share the URL with anyone, and they will be able to play your game through their web browser.

### Additional Tips

- **Make Changes**: If you need to make changes to your game, simply update the files in your local project, commit the changes, and push them to the GitHub repository. The GitHub Pages site will automatically update.
- **Debugging**: If you encounter issues, check the browser console for errors and ensure all file paths in your code are correct.

By following these steps, you can successfully host your game on GitHub and make it accessible to everyone on the internet!
